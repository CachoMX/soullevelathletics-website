              The Journey
            </h2>
            <div class="space-y-4 text-white/70 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                Chris Johnson's basketball journey took him from earning <strong class="text-white">NAIA All-American honors in 2017</strong> to competing on professional courts across the globe. He played professionally in <strong class="text-white">Mexico, Canada, Spain, Indonesia, and Malta</strong> — experiencing different systems, coaching styles, and levels of competition that shaped his unique approach to training.
              </p>
              <p>
                In <strong class="text-white">2020</strong>, Chris reached the pinnacle of domestic professional development, competing in the <strong class="text-white">NBA G League</strong>. Training alongside and against some of the most talented players in the world gave him an understanding of what it takes to perform at the highest level — and what separates good players from great ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Chris brings that same intensity, discipline, and game-tested knowledge to every athlete he coaches. Whether you're a youth player learning fundamentals or a college athlete preparing for the next level, Coach Chris delivers training rooted in real professional experience.

              <p>
                <strong class="text-brand-gold">No fluff. No shortcuts.</strong> Soul Level Athletics is built on the belief that real development comes from real work. Every drill, every exercise, and every session is designed with purpose — informed by what actually works at the professional level.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal isn't to create athletes who look good in practice. It's to develop <strong class="text-white">complete players who dominate in games</strong> — athletes who can think, react, and perform when it matters most.
